        Fashop Boutique Shop is a uniquely different shopping experience. Fashop
        was founded in 2011, OH. Fashop saw a need for a small business in her
        local community and decided to open a boutique. We now have grown to 10
        Brick & Mortar locations throughout Nairobi, which includes 3 franchise
        locations. We currently ship thousands of packages a week all across
        Kenya.
